# Using it with other MCP clients (including GPT)

**One package. Same files for everyone. Still offline.**

This is a plain MCP server that talks over **stdio** — a local pipe between the
client and the server on the same machine. There is no separate build for Claude
and another for GPT: it is the *same* `server.py` and the *same* bundled
libraries. The only thing that differs per client is one small step that tells
the client where the server lives.

The one-click `.mcpb` is just Claude Desktop's installer format. Every other
client points at the exact same server directly.

---

## Step 1 — get the files (once)

Two ways, both leave you with a `server.py` that has its libraries beside it:

- **From the release (offline, nothing to install).** The `.mcpb` is an ordinary
  ZIP. Rename it to `.zip` or open it with any archive tool and extract it to a
  folder, e.g. `C:\Tools\pc-screen-control\`. Inside you get `server.py`,
  `overlay.py` and a `lib/` folder with `uiautomation`, `comtypes` and `pillow`
  already in it. Nothing to install, no network.
- **From source.** Clone the repo and run `python src\server.py --install` once.
  That installs the two libraries into your own Python. Then point at
  `src\server.py`.

Either way you end up with a full path to a `server.py`. Keep it handy — every
client below just needs that path.

> Tip: run `python scripts\print-config.py` and it prints the ready-to-paste
> config below with your actual path already filled in.

## Step 2 — point your client at it

### Config-file clients — Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, Cline, Continue, Zed, Windsurf

All of these read a JSON block. Add this to the client's MCP config (the menu is
usually *Settings → MCP* or an `mcp.json` the client tells you about):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pc-screen-control": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["C:/Tools/pc-screen-control/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace the path with yours. Use forward slashes, or doubled backslashes
(`C:\\Tools\\...`). If `python` is not on your PATH, put the full path to
`python.exe` in `command`.

### GPT — the OpenAI Agents SDK / Codex

OpenAI's **Agents SDK** runs local MCP servers the same way Claude does — it
launches the process and talks over stdio. In your Python agent:

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner
from agents.mcp import MCPServerStdio

async def main():
    async with MCPServerStdio(
        params={"command": "python",
                "args": ["C:/Tools/pc-screen-control/server.py"]}
    ) as pc:
        agent = Agent(
            name="Desktop assistant",
            instructions="Use the PC Screen Control tools to operate Windows. "
                         "Start every task with describe_screen.",
            mcp_servers=[pc],
        )
        result = await Runner.run(agent, "List my open windows.")
        print(result.final_output)
```

That is the "install" for GPT: a few lines of code, pointing at the same
`server.py`. Nothing is hosted, nothing is exposed.

## What about the ChatGPT app itself?

**Deliberately not supported, and it should stay that way.** The consumer
ChatGPT app (Developer Mode "apps") only connects to **remote** MCP servers over
an HTTPS **URL** — it cannot launch a local one. To use this tool there you would
have to run your PC-control server as a public web endpoint and let a cloud
service reach into your machine through it. That throws away the entire point of
this project — the server that drives your mouse never touches the network.

So the rule is simple: **anything that runs the server locally (stdio) is
welcome and stays offline. Anything that needs it on a URL is out of scope by
design.** The OpenAI Agents SDK above is the offline way to use GPT with it.

---

## None of this adds a network connection

Every client on this page runs the server as a local process and speaks to it
over a pipe. The server has no network code (see `SECURITY.md` and
`tests/test_offline.py`), and the bundled `lib/` means it does not even reach out
to install anything. Adding a new *local* client changes none of that.
