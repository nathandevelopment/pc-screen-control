"""
The updater. Separate from the server on purpose.

The server that controls your PC makes no network connection at all - you can
grep it and check. This little program is the only part that talks to the
network, and it runs only when a person starts it by hand (CHECK-FOR-UPDATES.bat
double-clicked, or `python check-for-updates.py`). The server neither offers nor
triggers it, so there is no path by which the thing driving your mouse can reach
the internet on its own.

What it does, and nothing more:
  1. asks GitHub's public release API whether a newer version exists;
  2. if there is one, prints the version and the release page and asks you,
     in plain words, whether to download it;
  3. only after you type yes, downloads the .mcpb;
  4. verifies the download against the SHA-256 in the release notes before it is
     written to disk. On a mismatch it refuses and saves nothing.

It never installs anything and never touches your Claude config. You install the
downloaded file yourself, the same way as the first time.
