## The most useful contribution

An application where the tree comes back empty or wrong, with its
`describe_screen` output. The window `class` and `framework` are what determine
whether it can be read at all, and no amount of reasoning substitutes for
someone running it against software I do not own.

## Running it

```
pip install -r src/requirements.txt
python tests/test_installer.py     # setup logic, runs anywhere
python tests/test_update_verify.py # the update download is hash-checked
python tests/test_offline.py       # no network, no runtime install, 0 sockets
python tests/test_encoding.py      # non-ASCII survives the protocol
python tests/test_refs.py          # refs resolve, and invoke refuses the mouse
python tests/test_takeover.py      # blind input stops if the user took over
python tests/test_restore.py       # focus is really given back, measured
python tests/test_handover.py      # freeze, look, act, restore, release
python tests/test_claim.py         # parking a window, and the crash rescue
python tests/measure_desktop.py    # measures the desktop you are sitting at
python tests/stress.py             # cost, nonsense, broken protocol, ~1 min
python src/server.py --install     # register it with your MCP client
```

CI runs all eleven on Windows against Python 3.9, 3.11 and 3.13.

## The one rule

**Measure before you claim.** Every number in the README came from
`tests/measure_desktop.py`, and several of them contradicted what I had written
the week before — Chromium was labelled a limitation for two releases before a
measurement showed the probe was at fault, not the browser.

If you add a capability, add the check that would fail if it stopped working.
Prefer a test that reads the result back over one that asserts no exception was
raised: three tools shipped reporting success for things they had not done, and
each was caught by a test that looked at the value afterwards.

## Style

- One file per concern; the server is deliberately one readable file.
- Comments explain **why**, not what. If a line looks wrong until you know a
  Windows quirk, write the quirk down.
- Every action returns state before and after. A tool that cannot prove its
  effect says so instead of returning `ok`.
