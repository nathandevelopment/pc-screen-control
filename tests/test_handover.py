"""
The handover, end to end: freeze, look, act, restore, release. In that order.

Two orderings matter and both were wrong once.

Checking the target and *then* freezing input leaves a gap in which a click
still lands. That was fixed first. Releasing the input and *then* restoring the
screen is the same race mirrored: the keyboard comes back while the screen still
points wherever the action left it, so a keystroke goes into the wrong window at
the exact moment the guard believes it has finished. Both gaps are short, both
fail only sometimes, and a guard that fails only sometimes is worse than none
because it gets trusted.

There is also a quieter one. The state used to be photographed before the lock
closed, so it recorded the screen as it was *before* the user's last keystroke
arrived - and then faithfully restored them to a moment that never finished
happening.

What is asserted here is the order itself, not the presence of the calls. Every
version that was broken had all the calls.
