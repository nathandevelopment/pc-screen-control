"""
Regression test for the failure that made this check exist.

An assistant read a form, the person watching clicked into a chat window, and
the assistant then sent Enter. The keystroke went to the chat, because a
keystroke with no target goes wherever focus happens to be. The tool had always
returned a note saying "confirm this landed where you intended" - which is read
after the damage, not before it, and is therefore not a safeguard at all.

Telling "the user moved the focus" apart from "we moved it" looks like it needs
to know who generated an event, and Windows will not say: GetLastInputInfo
counts injected input as input. The question can be answered without that. The
foreground window is recorded after every tool call, so anything the server did
is already in the baseline; a change that shows up between calls came from
outside. That is the person, or a window that stole focus by itself, and
neither is somewhere to type blindly.

Checked here:
  1. Nothing moved  -> blind keystrokes go through.
  2. Foreground moved between calls -> refused, with both windows named.
  3. force=true     -> goes through anyway, because sometimes it is right.
